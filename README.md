Welcome to the **Multi-Agentic Content Creation System**, a powerful framework designed to automate content creation across multiple platforms. This system leverages a network of specialized agents to research, create, optimize, and distribute high-quality content. From blog posts to social media updates, everything is orchestrated to ensure a seamless, engaging experience for content creators and marketers.

## üöÄ Overview

This system is composed of several agents, each responsible for a unique step in the content creation process. The flow is managed by the **Orchestrator** agent, which ensures that each task is completed and communicated effectively, even in case of failures.

### Key Agents

- **Orchestrator**: Manages the flow of the entire content creation process and ensures communication between all agents.
- **Researcher Agent**: Gathers relevant data, topics, and sources for content creation.
- **Blog Writer Agent**: Creates blog posts based on research data.
- **Twitter Agent**: Curates engaging tweets based on blog content and relevant web searches.
- **LinkedIn Agent**: Creates professional and engaging LinkedIn posts.
- **Optimizing Agent**: Refines the content to ensure it‚Äôs engaging, humanized, and user-friendly.

## üîÑ System Flow

The system operates as follows:

1. **Orchestrator Invocation**: The system starts when the `/start` endpoint is triggered. The orchestrator first checks the `/health` endpoint to confirm all agents are operational.
2. **Data Collection**: The orchestrator collects topics, links, and further information from the provided spreadsheet, passing the data to the **Researcher Agent**.
3. **Research Phase**: The **Researcher Agent** gathers in-depth data and returns the results to the orchestrator.
4. **Blog Writing**: The **Blog Writer Agent** then takes the research and generates three blog posts.
5. **Social Media Content Creation**:
   - The **Twitter Agent** creates engaging tweets, including AI-related content, humor, and news updates.
   - The **LinkedIn Agent** creates educational and entertaining posts for LinkedIn.
6. **Optimization**: The **Optimizing Agent** refines the content to make it more engaging and user-friendly.
7. **Final Output**: Once all agents complete their tasks, the orchestrator sends the content in JSON format to the user via email, including:
   - Three blog posts in JSON format
   - Tweets in JSON format
   - LinkedIn posts in JSON format
